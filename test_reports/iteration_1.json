  "summary": "Completed comprehensive end-to-end testing of the retro blocky gamified developer portfolio landing page. All core features are working correctly including hero section, navigation, coin counter, skills section with animated progress bars, projects section with 6 cards and dialogs, contact form, and footer. The pixel styling (3px borders, 0px radius, box shadows) is consistently applied across all interactive elements. Framer Motion animations are working on scroll and hover. Responsive design works on both mobile and desktop viewports. All fonts (Pixelify Sans, Press Start 2P, Figtree) are loaded correctly. No backend testing was required as this is a frontend-only portfolio page.",
